## More details

### 🧭 Routing

- Home page with search results
- "Favorites" page
- "Not Found" page

### 📦 State Management

- **Redux slices** for managing app state
- **createAsyncThunk** for API requests
- **redux-persist** to persist app state and favorites list

### ⌛ Loading & Error Handling

- **Skeleton loader** for books while data is loading
- **Spinner** for favorites and book preview loading states
- Message when no books are found
- Message when there are no more books to display

### 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy loading** of pages
- **useMemo** for memoizing book thumbnails

### 🖼️ Styling and Responsiveness

- Responsive layout down to 360px screen width (SCSS Modules)
- Responsive modal windows

### 🔧 Error Handling in API

- **Duplicate books returned by the API**: filtered out in the reducer by book ID

- **Missing items field in API response when books run out**: additional **NO_MORE_BOOKS status** introduced to handle this scenario gracefully
